## Overview
  Steve is helping his parents actively manage their portfolio, and as friends, we are helping Steve. The workbook we prepared for their family throughout the module was very useful. But now Steve is looking to tinker with the information being pulled and we see this as an opportunity to reevaluate the effenciency of our code. The idea is to alter the data set we are collecting into our table, while creating a tickerindex variable that allows us to create it with one comprehensive loop which reduces our run time.
